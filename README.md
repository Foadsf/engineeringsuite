# Engineering Suite

Program for solving non-linear equation systems.

## About

Open source and multiplatform equation solver written in Java. This project allows users to solve systems of non-linear equations, particularly engineering-type equations. It includes a database of thermodynamical properties for various substances including steam, air, nitrogen, argon, butane, propane, and more.

## Features

- Solves systems of non-linear algebraic equation in an easy way
- Includes trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic, and exponential functions
- Thermodynamic property database for many substances
- Complete GUI with undo/redo, save/load, and export to PDF
- Four globally convergent algorithms for solving equation systems
- Mathematical symbolic program based on Matheclipse
- Available in English and Spanish

## Example

For solving the second Newton law you only have to introduce the following code:

```
F = M * A /*It includes trigonometric, hiperbolic, logarithms and exponential functions*/
M = 2 * 2 + 1 - 1 + sin(Pi) + sinh(2.7)
A = 2^2*(exp(2/3)+log(1))
```
